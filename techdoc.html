          The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every
          other SCM out there is its branching model. Git allows and encourages
          you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent
          of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of
          development takes seconds.
        </p>
        <p>This means that you can do things like:</p>
        <p>
          Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.</p>
          <p>Role-Based Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.</p>
           <p>Feature Based Workflow. Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.</p>
          <p>Disposable Experimentation. Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the workâ€”with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).</p>
<img src="https://git-scm.com/images/about/branches@2x.png" alt="git like-image" class="image" />
        <p>
          Notably, when you push to a remote repository, you do not have to push all of your branches. You can choose to share just one of your branches, a few of them, or all of them. This tends to free people to try new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when they are going to merge it in or share it with others.
        </p>
        <p>There are ways to accomplish some of this with other systems, but the work involved is much more difficult and error-prone. Git makes this process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers work when they learn it.

        <header>Printing to the console</header>
        <p>Inorder to print to the console. We use System.out.Printin.</p>
        <p>
          I know,it is very long and cumbersome, but this is the way it's done.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                public class MyMainFunction {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        // Java Function Example
                        System.out.println("Hello, world!"); // Example: Prints "Hello, world!"
                        
                        // You can add more code and functionality here
                    }
                }
                
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this example we are printing out "Hello World" to the console when
          we run the programe.

        <p>
          Functions are actually called methods in Java. Here is an example of
          how to declare a Java method.

        alt="java-method-img" class="image" />
        <p>Some copiable code:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                    public static void myFunction(String name, int age) 
                    {
                        // function code
                       
                }

      <section class="main-section" id="Object_Oriented_Programming">
        <header>Object Oriented Programming</header>
        <p>Java is known as an object oriented programming language.</p>
        <p>
          This means that it is easy to represent entities as objects by using
          classes and encapsulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          An exammple of this might be a Student class to represent a student
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                public class Student {
                    /* Student properties */
                    private String name;
                    private int age;

                    /* Constructctor */
                    public Student(String name,int age){
                        this.name = name;
                        this.age = age;
                    }

                    /* Getter method */
                    public String getName(){
                        return name;
                    }

                    /* Setter method */
                    public void setName(String name){
                        this.name = name;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>We use this class by doing the following:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                Student student = new Student("Jimmy" 19);
                String jimmyName = student1.getName();
                student1.setName("Kevin");
                string kevinName = student1.getName();
            </code>
